        <h2>Alma 48:17</h2>
        <p>Yea, verily, verily I say unto you, if all men had been, and were, 
            and ever would be, like unto Moroni, behold, the very powers of hell 
            would have been shaken forever; yea, the devil would never have power 
            over the hearts of the children of men.</p>

        <h2>Moroni 10:30-33</h2>
        <p>And awake, and arise from the dust, O Jerusalem; yea, and put on thy 
            beautiful garments, O daughter of Zion; and strengthen thy stakes 
            and enlarge thy borders forever, that thou mayest no more be confounded, 
            that the covenants of the Eternal Father which he hath made unto thee, 
            O house of Israel, may be fulfilled. Yea, come unto Christ, and be 
            perfected in him, and deny yourselves of all ungodliness; and if ye 
            shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness, and love God with all your 
            might, mind and strength, then is his grace sufficient for you, that 
            by his grace ye may be perfect in Christ; and if by the grace of God 
            ye are perfect in Christ, ye can in nowise deny the power of God. And 
            again, if ye by the grace of God are perfect in Christ, and deny not 
            his power, then are ye sanctified in Christ by the grace of God, 
            through the shedding of the blood of Christ, which is in the covenant 
            of the Father unto the remission of your sins, that ye become holy, 
            without spot.</p>
